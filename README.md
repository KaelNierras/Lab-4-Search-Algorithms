## Searching Algorithm Visualization
The Searching Algorithm Visualization application offers an interactive tool for visualizing two widely-used search algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). Users can explore the inner workings of these algorithms through a dynamic and user-friendly visual representation provided by the application.
# Feature
The function of 5 buttons:
1. **Prevous Step:**
   Make the animation move backward
2. **Next Step:**
   Make the animation move forward
3. **Auto Play:**
   Make the animation play from the current animation to last animation
4. **DFS:**
   Change the Seaching Algorithm to Depth-First Search (DFS)
4. **BFS:**
   Change the Seaching Algorithm to Breadth-First Search (DFS)
